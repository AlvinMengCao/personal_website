                                Start using it since 2013. At that time I just use it write some click event in html. But!
                                Just after it became an object-oriented language from weak script, I was so surprised about what
                                it can do. So, I learned the <b>jQuery</b>, which save me a lot of time operating DOM. Then I
                                learned <b>AngularJS</b>, which can keep my page really clean and make it as modules. <b>BackBone
                                </b> is pretty similar as AngularJS, so I just learn it to expand my horizon. After knowing the
                                main functions of jQuery(selecting element, operating css class, operating event, animation and
                                Ajax request) and AngularJS(module, controller, service, directive), now I can easily achieve
                                what I want with the help of API document. Maybe you already noticed I build <b>this website</b> with
                                AngularJS!

                            for a long time, but languages always have something similar. Thanks my foundation of Java and
                            javascript, now I can skillfully use it especially in Rails. Its magic grammar always save me

                            I built a Ruby on Rails version, but as you know deployment of Rails app is not that easy, so I
