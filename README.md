Build this app to introduce myself and practice AngularJS. Before this, I had a Ruby on Rails version. Depoly it on heroku. Hopefully I can successfully use NodeJS within it.

Using Bootstrap, jQueryï¼ŒAngularJS. Built it as a Single Page Application.



Now, totally static webpage, so I use index.php to let the heroku config it as a php application.
